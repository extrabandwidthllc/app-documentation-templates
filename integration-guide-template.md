# PagerDuty + ***[IO Informant](https://www.ioinformant.com)*** Integration Benefits

* ***Notify on-call responders based on alerts sent from IO Informant.***
* ***Create high and low urgency incidents based on the severity of the event from the Datadog event payload.***
* ***Incidents are sent from IO Informant to PagerDuty.***
* ***Incidents will wait for a human to resolve the incident manually before another alert is sent for an outage.***

# How it Works

* ***IO Informant monitors inbound heartbeats from your services, and it actively monitors websites and APIs. When a service or batch job skips a heartbeat, when a website fails to load, or when an API fails to respond properly, IO Informant can send an alert to your PagerDuty account and your on-call team. ***
* ***Once an alert has been resolved, your on-call team will need to click the `resolve` button in PagerDuty.***


# Requirements

* ***PagerDuty integrations require an Admin base role for account authorization. If you do not have this role, please reach out to an Admin or Account Owner within your organization to configure the integration.***
